Python list comprehensions can be used to create lists in a very natural way. 
To create a list, think of the formulae or relationship between each item. 

To modify styling and highlight colors edit `/_sass/_pygments.scss`.

{% highlight python %}
SQ = [x**2 for x in range(40)]
V = [2**i for i in range(10)]
{% endhighlight %}
